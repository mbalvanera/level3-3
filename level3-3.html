I<br> want to<br> be your perfect<br> scent, your missed rent,<br> those days you feel you<br> need to repent. 
I want you<br> to listen to these cheesy rhymes, feeding<br> me these sweet lines, be together all the<br> time. 
I want to be your dark brown hair,<br> the place back when we didn't care, the memories<br> only we share. 

I want you in all the ways<br> I can say. 
I'll want you forever and always each and<br> every day.
           
           
I never knew you could know me so much better<br>
I ignored all the great weather 
the darkest cloud hung over me and<br> I let my head fall on the air
my hair was still wet but not the day that we<br> met

Was it someone like you who did it to be so kind
Leaves on the grass with<br> words drawn out
You admired me and wanted to hold my hand
I let the curtains fly<br> in
Didn’t want the wind to pass me by

Wearing the t-shirts with the cheesiest slogans
Dropping<br> love on my sleeve
Too many wishes that I hope they’re not an omen
I never knew a heart could beat for me
